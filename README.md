# js_sub_array_tests

I put this together to test out some of the advice provided in this excellent
article:
http://perfectionkills.com/how-ecmascript-5-still-does-not-allow-to-subclass-an-array/

I wanted to see how much of this was still true, several years on. This advice
was also provided mostly for web browsers, and I wanted to see how Node.JS
affected the outcomes.

## Getting Started

You'll need the CLI module for [grunt](http://gruntjs.com) installed globally:

    npm install -g grunt-cli

In the project root, run:

    npm install

That will install the npm modules required for running the unit tests.

Once that's done, you can run the unit tests with:

    grunt
